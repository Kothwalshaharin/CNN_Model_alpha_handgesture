# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition Project

This project is a **Hand Gesture Recognition System** built using [your framework — e.g., Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or MediaPipe].  
It detects and classifies hand gestures in real-time using a webcam or pre-recorded video/images.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Real-time hand gesture detection via webcam  
- ✅ Recognizes multiple gestures (e.g., ✌️, 👍, 👎, ✋)  
- ✅ Supports custom datasets and training  
- ✅ Lightweight and easy to run  
- ✅ Modular code (easy to extend for new gestures)
